This general education course introduced students to key concepts in social psychology without requiring prior knowledge of psychology. The aim was to help students think critically about everyday social issues using scientific perspectives.

The course also supported university-wide learning goals, such as developing problem-solving skills, expressing ideas clearly, and working effectively in groups.

Course Topics and Format
======

The course began with an orientation covering basic psychology and the goals of the class. It then explored a variety of social topics — such as emotions, romantic relationships, cooperation, social norms, adaptation, and the digital society — from a psychological perspective.

Each topic was covered over two sessions: the first focused on key concepts and theories, and the second involved discussion of how those ideas applied to modern society. Group work and class discussions were the central part of the course.
