Welcome to my page! I am Kazu, a PhD student at the Department of Psychology, the University of Bath. Currently, I am contributing to a research program on **online radicalisation through interaction with generative AI**. My work focuses on data-driven approaches to social and psychological phenomena, combining computational tools and experimental methods.

Before joining the University of Bath, I worked as a Project-Specific Associate Professor at Kobe University and an Adviser for Political and Economic Affairs at the Embassy of Japan in Estonia.


In addition to academic work, I enjoy reading, watching films, learning languages, and going for long walks. I'm also a bit of a wine and whisky enthusiast - always happy to unwind with a good drink and good company.

Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in my work (hh2334 [at] bath.ac.uk).
