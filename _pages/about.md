Welcome to my page! I am Hirokazu Hatta, a Project-specific Assistant Professor at the Graduate School of Humanities, Kobe University. Currently, I am contributing to a research program titled **"Loneliness in New Life: Visualization of Risks and Primary Prevention."** My work focuses on data-driven approaches to social and psychological phenomena, combining computational tools and experimental methods.

Before joining Kobe University, I worked as an Adviser for Political and Economic Affairs at the Embassy of Japan in Estonia.


In addition to academic work, I enjoy reading, watching films, learning languages, and going for long walks. I'm also a bit of a wine and whisky enthusiast - always happy to unwind with a good drink and good company.

Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in my work (k0143115 [at] gsuite.kobe-u.ac.jp).
